/**
 * RUNTIME — mutable session state that crosses module boundaries.
 * Each field has exactly ONE writer; every other module reads through
 * the getters. Keeping this tiny and import-free breaks what would
 * otherwise be circular dependencies (engine ↔ stream ↔ trade).
 *
 *   candleTrend  written by signals.refreshCandleTrend  ("Up"|"Down"|"Flat"|null)
 *   vwap         written by signals.refreshIntradayTrend (today's VWAP | null)
 *   vwapRef      written by signals.refreshIntradayTrend — the price to compare
 *                against vwap when it was computed from FUTURES candles (indices
 *                trade no volume); null = compare live spot (underlying-space VWAP)
 *   volumeSurge  written by signals.refreshIntradayTrend (latest/avg 5-min volume | null)
 *   futuresBuildup written by signals.updateFuturesBuildup ({label, direction} | null)
 *   lastResult   written by engine.run every poll        (latest analyze() output)
 *   liveTicks    written by stream on websocket messages (key → {ltp, cp, greeks, at})
 *   closingIds   claimed by trade.closePosition           (double-close guard)
 *   liveTrading  written by prompts.setupInstrument       (LIVE_TRADING=1 + typed YES)

/**
 * HORIZONS — trading-horizon profiles: intraday, positional, swing.
 *
 * Playbook mapping ("Types of Traders" + tool rules):
 *   Day trader        → intraday:   nothing held overnight, 5-min tools,
 *                                    15:20 square-off, product I
 *   Positional trader → positional: held days → 1 MONTH, daily timeframe,
 *                                    20/50 daily SMA trend, product D
 *   Swing trader      → swing:      held up to 3 MONTHS, daily timeframe,
 *                                    100/200 daily SMA trend (the playbook's
 *                                    investment MA rule), product D
 *
 * Profile fields:
 *   product            broker product: "I" intraday / "D" carry-forward
 *   pollMs             chain poll interval (overrides CONFIG.pollMs)
 *   trend              {source:"intraday"} = last six 5-min candles;
 *                      {source:"daily-ma", fast, slow} = SMA crossover on
 *                      daily candles (fast above slow = Up — playbook MA rule)
 *   trendRefreshMs     how often to recompute the trend
 *   squareOff          true → forced 15:20 IST exit + no entries after
 *   maxHoldDays        TIME_STOP: exit any position held this long (null = off)
 *   minEntryDTE        block entries when expiry is nearer than this many
 *                      days — a weekly expiry cannot host a one-month view
 *   exitBufferDays     EXPIRY_STOP: exit when expiry is this close, BEFORE
 *                      the gamma/theta cliff ("on the day of expiry, all
 *                      of the greeks aren't important" — playbook)
 *   signalPersistence  SIGNAL_CHANGE only after this many CONSECUTIVE
 *                      mismatching polls — multi-day positions must not be
 *                      churned out by one noisy 5-minute tick
 *   plannedHoldDays    horizon for the theta gate: projected decay over
 *                      this many days must not eat >50% of the target move
 *
 * Sample data — same Bull Call Spread plan under each horizon:
 *   intraday:   expiry 4d away OK (minEntryDTE 0), exits by 15:20 today
 *   positional: expiry 4d away  → ⛔ blocked (needs ≥10 DTE — pick monthly);
 *               expiry 32d away → enters product D, TIME_STOP at 30d,
 *               EXPIRY_STOP when DTE ≤ 2, bias flip must persist 3 polls
 *   swing:      expiry 32d away → ⛔ blocked (needs ≥30... use a far
 *               monthly, e.g. 81d) → TIME_STOP 90d, EXPIRY_STOP DTE ≤ 5
